# a-Shell-commands
shell commands, pre-compiled to webAssembly, ready to use in a-Shell

## Purpose

[a-Shell](https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell) is a terminal for iOS. Several commands are provided, pre-compiled to iOS format. With the latest release (1.4.x), you can also execute commands compiled to webAssemly (wasm). If the command creates, writes or reads local files, it is best to use the specific [WASI-sdk](https://github.com/holzschu/wasi-sdk) to compile them. 

Once compiled to webAssembly, binaries can be shared with other users of a-Shell. Click on the command you want, download it to your iPad or iPhone, move it to `~/Documents/bin/` and use it (a-Shell will add ".wasm" at the end and call the webAssembly JIT compiler on commands that are in the PATH).

file, ffmpeg, tree, ctags, readtags and xz are also part of the a-Shell AppStore release.

The idea is that we can share pre-compiled commands. Submit yours through pull-requests. 

## Install from a-Shell

```sh
# list available commands
pkg search 

# pkg install [command]
pkg install base64
pkg install which
pkg install strings
pkg install column

# list installed commands
pkg list
```
